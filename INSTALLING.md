1. Configure your new application, then click on the `Create App` button. ![example](http://i.imgur.com/3I4tz0P.png)<br>

Here's, this application would have these caracteristics:

* name: `Beaftek's bot`
* description: `An awesome bot wow such very good. I bet you're jealous`
* icon: [this image](http://i.imgur.com/6xpTNLr.png)

**Note**: Changing app's icon / name wouldn't change your bot's avatar / name. It would change your *app's icon / name*. If you wanna change your bot's name / avatar, you would be able to do it directly using bot's commands. (module `Owner`).
